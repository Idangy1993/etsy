Just him… chuckling about how scared he was.\n🔹 Is it real or satire? Is he trolling, mentally unstable, or just pranking?\n🔹 Why film it? Is this some weird form of bravery flex? Or is he aware how strange it looks?\n\nWhat I want to know:\n\nDoes anyone know the backstory—why he filmed this reaction at all?\n\nIs there more footage (perhaps the “attempt” part)?\n\nThoughts on what the hell this actually is: a freak-out, a performance, or some kind of stunt?\n\nFor me, it’s the dissonance that’s haunting—the idea that someone literally just escaped death, then films themselves poking fun at their own terror. It’s dark, disorienting… and oddly fascinating.",

Instead… she hits me with, “I’ve always wanted to know how it feels to kill someone.”\n\nNaturally, I asked her to explain, and she said she’s been watching a lot of mystery and it’s made her curious about what that experience would feel.\n\nNow I’m sitting here like… is this just dark humor, or am I into a future true crime doc subject?😂\n\n\nI know we all have fantasies, but that was  wayy overboard ",

I date across the gender spectrum and live somewhere between “deeply cozy” and “beautiful chaos.” I’m currently stuck in Iowa (send help), but the goal is to escape to somewhere basic human rights aren’t up for debate.\n\n\nI contain multitudes: part Fortnite goblin, part D&D world-builder, full-time romantasy addict. Basically, I’m a chaotic cozy mess with a big heart and an even bigger ass. 🍑\n\n\n💜 I live with one partner (we date separately, no throuple invites, k thx). I’ve also got two rad, school-aged kids so bonus points if you’re cool with occasional chaos and understand the bedtime struggle is real. 😩\n\n\nBare minimum?\nText me daily. Let's play Fortnite a few times a week. This is the floor not the ceiling.  \n👻Ghost me for days and I’ll assume you’ve been eaten by wolves and move on accordingly. 🐺💋\n\nIf your opener is ‘hey,’ prepare to be ghosted faster than my career ambitions 👻 gimme some substance in your initial message. \n\nLong-distance?\nMy love language isn’t “road trips” or “boarding passes.” I’d rather stay cute and stationary. So unless you're putting in the miles, maybe don’t shoot your shot from four states away. 🫣\n\n\nCouples? \nI’m not your unicorn, not your third, and definitely not your kinky little side quest. I'm open to being friends with people in a couple! But platonic only. 😌\n\nOh! One last thing! If your politics aren’t aligned with queer rights, BLM, and basic human decency (yes, that includes f*** ICE), then babe, we’re not even in the same multiverse.\n\n\n",

Take This Brief Quiz.\n\n**1.** Have you recently lost the plot, the plan, or the person you were supposed to become?  \n☐ Yes  ☐ No  ☐ I think so but I’m still pretending otherwise\n\n**2.** Do well-meaning people keep saying things like “Everything happens for a reason”?  \n☐ Yes  ☐ If one more person does I will scream  ☐ I said it once. I regret it\n\n**3.** Do you now require a nap, a cry, or a gentle feral scream to complete basic tasks?  \n☐ Yes  ☐ Obviously  ☐ That’s my daily to-do list\n\n**4.** Are you asked if you’ve recovered yet or if you’re better by now?  \n☐ Yes, but I can handle it  \n☐ Yes, but I can’t handle it  \n☐ No  \n☐ No, and how do I make them stop\n\nIf you answered **Yes** to any of the above… congratulations.  \nIf you answered **Yes** to *all* of the above, you may already be here — but it’s time to make it official.\n\n# 📍 What to Expect (and What Not To)\n\n**Don’t expect:**  \n✖️ A 5-star spa experience  \n✖️ A typical rehab and recovery destination  \n✖️ A sleek boutique hotel  \n✖️ A linear recovery path  \n✖️ Inspirational playlists  \n✖️ Happy recovery stories  \n✖️ Lectures on resilience  \n✖️ Closure  \n✖️ A welcome ceremony (unless you count crying in your car)\n\n**Do expect:**  \n✔️ Bureaucratic weirdness  \n✔️ Unfamiliar but intriguing place names  \n✔️ Glorious disorientation  \n✔️ Fellow travelers you’ve never seen before but instantly recognize  \n✔️ Unsolicited advice, if you’re open to it  \n✔️ Accidental community  \n✔️ Your own private Ministry (likely several — and if you don’t find the one you need, feel free to suggest it; **BestGuessistan is always open to innovation**)\n\nSome find clarity. Some find mischief.  \nMost find snacks and try again tomorrow.\n\n# 📚 Practical Information for Visitors\n\n# 🛬 Getting Here\n\nNo flights. No ferries.  \nMost arrivals are unplanned.  \nOne minute you're managing your life; the next, you're filling out paperwork for the **Ministry of Unfinished Thoughts**.\n\nPopular arrival portals include:  \n• Sudden loss  \n• Any type of rupture  \n• Medical diagnosis  \n• Cognitive implosion  \n• Slow-burning existential unraveling  \n• A failed yoga retreat (it happens)\n\n# 🗣️ Language\n\nThe local dialect will seem familiar and unfamiliar at once, and includes:  \n“I’m fine” (not fine)  \n“Just tired” (deep soul depletion)  \n“This is my new normal?” (spoken mid-panic)\n\nFluency in metaphor is helpful.  \nMetaphor coaches are available 24/7, though they may speak in riddles.  \nSilence is a second language.\n\n(See also: **Ministry of Miscommunication & Other People’s Expectations**)\n\n# 🚕 Getting Around\n\nMost movement is emotional. All directions are approximate.  \nRoads often loop.  \nMaps are crowdsourced.  \nSome routes are imaginary.\n\nBestGuessistan’s only subway line is the **Circular Reasoning Loop**.  \nIt never stops, but the announcements are oddly comforting — and always audible.\n\nBring snacks and a vague sense of humor. Or irony. Preferably both.\n\n(See: **Ministry of Overthinking & Second Guessing**)\n\n# 💰 Currency\n\nWe use spoons, stickers, and small wins.\n\nBarter system encouraged:  \n• “I showed up today.”  \n• “I sent the email I’ve been avoiding for 3 weeks.”  \n• “Sure, I’ll try something else.”\n\nA single deep breath can buy you a coffee and a sticker.\n\n(See also: **Department of Emotional Logistics**)\n\n# 🧘‍♀️ Customs & Etiquette\n\n• Failure is normal  \n• Judgment is not allowed  \n• Disorientation is encouraged  \n• We do not celebrate “bouncing back”  \n• Please remove your expectations before entering shared spaces\n\n(For detailed codes of conduct, consult the **Ministry of Internal Affairs & Inexplicable Feelings**)\n\n# 📦 What to Pack\n\n• Your last known self  \n• Extra softness  \n• A playlist with no skip guilt  \n• Snacks labeled “emotional support”  \n• Comfortable pants and complicated feelings\n\n# ⭐️ BestGuessistan: As Reviewed by Fellow Travelers\n\n>\n\n# 🏁 Final Thought\n\nBestGuessistan isn’t the trip you planned.  \nIt’s the one you take when the itinerary burns — and you have to make meaning from the ashes.\n\n**BestGuessistan may be the trip you need.**\n\nThe good news?  \nThe views are strange but stunning.  \nAnd the locals?  \nThey get it.\n\n**Ministries referenced:**\n\n* \\[Ministry of Unfinished Thoughts\\]\n* \\[Ministry of Overthinking & Second Guessing\\]\n* \\[Ministry of Miscommunication & Other People’s Expectations\\]\n* \\[Ministry of Internal Affairs & Inexplicable Feelings\\]\n* \\[Department of Emotional Logistics\\]",
